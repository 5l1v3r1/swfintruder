# Introduction #
'''SWFIntruder''' is a tool developed by [Stefano Di Paola](http://www.wisec.it) and maintained by  [OWASP](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:SWFIntruder) in  designed to perform a security analysis of Flash applications.
It helps to find flaws in Flash applications using the methodology originally described by Stefano Di Paola in [Testing Flash Applications](http://www.owasp.org/images/8/8c/OWASPAppSec2007Milan_TestingFlashApplications.ppt) (May 2007) and in [Finding Vulnerabilities in Flash Applications](http://www.owasp.org/images/d/df/SanJose_AppSec2007_DiPaola.ppt) (Nov 2007).

SWFIntruder was developed using ActionScript, Html and JavaScript resulting in
a tool taking advantage of the best features of those technologies in order to
get the best capabilities for analysis and interaction with the testing Flash movies.

SWFIntruder was developed by using only open source software.
Thanks to its generality, SWFIntruder is OS independent.

Visit SWFIntruder [home page](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:SWFIntruder) for more details and the [OWASP Flash Security Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Flash_Security_Project) for a broad overview about Flash security.

## Goals ##

SWFIntruder purpose is to analyze a Flash application for version =< 8 and to
help check in a semi automated fashion the presence of security issues like
Cross Site Scripting and Cross Site Flashing.

Moreover does help raise awareness around the subject of flash
applications security and how that can be used to and assist in the
security of applications.
